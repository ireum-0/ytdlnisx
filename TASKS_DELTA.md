### BUG-SCHEDULER-05 — Treat pre-Android-12 exact-alarm capability as available

**State:** Open  
**Reviewed checkpoint:** `dfa40697434b7d041bb0bc4f3d9cf2586dfb6d15`  
**Verification:** `SOURCE-LEVEL ONLY`

**Failure path:** the app supports Android API 24 and above. `DownloadSettingsFragment` allows the daily `use_scheduler` setting to be enabled on API 24–30 and calls `AlarmScheduler.schedule()` because it only requests the Android 12 exact-alarm special access when `SDK_INT >= 31`. Later, when a user queues a Download outside the configured scheduler window, `DownloadViewModel` calls `AlarmScheduler.canSchedule()` before persisting the queued work. `AlarmScheduler.canSchedule()` returns `false` for every API below 31 solely because `AlarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()` is unavailable there. `DownloadViewModel` interprets that false result as unavailable exact-alarm authority, disables `use_scheduler`, marks the queue request unsuccessful, and reports the alarm-permission message instead of using the supported pre-Android-12 exact-alarm path.

Android's platform contract makes this a false capability result rather than an unavailable feature: `AlarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()` was added in API 31, and the exact-alarm special-access requirement begins with Android 12 / API 31 for apps targeting that level. The supported API 24–30 band therefore must not be represented as incapable merely because the API-31 capability query does not exist.

**Why this is a defect:** a supported OS band can enable the scheduler in settings but then have ordinary queueing outside the window reject the same scheduler configuration and silently turn it off. The failure is deterministic from the SDK-version branch and blocks a user-requested scheduling workflow even though the platform can schedule the exact alarms the implementation uses. This is distinct from `BUG-SCHEDULER-01` (daily recurrence/midnight semantics), `BUG-SCHEDULER-03` (successor alarms for individually scheduled AlarmManager work), and `BUG-SCHEDULER-04` (daily shutdown cancelling future WorkManager carriers).

Required result:

- define exact-alarm capability by platform version: API 24–30 must be treated as available when the `AlarmManager` service exists; API 31+ must use the platform exact-alarm capability/permission contract;
- make Settings, normal queueing, Observe Source, low-quality redownload, and every other caller interpret the capability helper consistently;
- never disable `use_scheduler` or reject a queue action on API 24–30 merely because `canScheduleExactAlarms()` is an API-31 method;
- preserve the existing API-31+ permission-request/failure behavior when exact-alarm access is actually unavailable;
- add API-band tests for at least API 24/30, API 31+ with access, and API 31+ without access, plus a production-path queue regression proving pre-31 scheduler queueing persists work and arms the scheduler rather than returning the permission failure.
