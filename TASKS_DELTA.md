### BUG-SCHEDULER-05 — Treat pre-Android-12 exact-alarm capability as available

**State:** Open  
**Reviewed checkpoint:** `dfa40697434b7d041bb0bc4f3d9cf2586dfb6d15`  
**Verification:** `SOURCE-LEVEL ONLY`

**Failure path:** the app supports Android API 24 and above. `DownloadSettingsFragment` allows the daily `use_scheduler` setting to be enabled on API 24–30 and calls `AlarmScheduler.schedule()` because it only requests the Android 12 exact-alarm special access when `SDK_INT >= 31`. Later, when a user queues a Download outside the configured scheduler window, `DownloadViewModel` calls `AlarmScheduler.canSchedule()` before persisting the queued work. `AlarmScheduler.canSchedule()` returns `false` for every API below 31 solely because `AlarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()` is unavailable there. `DownloadViewModel` interprets that false result as unavailable exact-alarm authority, disables `use_scheduler`, marks the queue request unsuccessful, and reports the alarm-permission message instead of using the supported pre-Android-12 exact-alarm path.

Android's platform contract makes this a false capability result rather than an unavailable feature: `AlarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()` was added in API 31, and the exact-alarm special-access requirement begins with Android 12 / API 31 for apps targeting that level. The supported API 24–30 band therefore must not be represented as incapable merely because the API-31 capability query does not exist.

**Why this is a defect:** a supported OS band can enable the scheduler in settings but then have ordinary queueing outside the window reject the same scheduler configuration and silently turn it off. The failure is deterministic from the SDK-version branch and blocks a user-requested scheduling workflow even though the platform can schedule the exact alarms the implementation uses. This is distinct from `BUG-SCHEDULER-01` (daily recurrence/midnight semantics), `BUG-SCHEDULER-03` (successor alarms for individually scheduled AlarmManager work), and `BUG-SCHEDULER-04` (daily shutdown cancelling future WorkManager carriers).

Required result:

- define exact-alarm capability by platform version: API 24–30 must be treated as available when the `AlarmManager` service exists; API 31+ must use the platform exact-alarm capability/permission contract;
- make Settings, normal queueing, Observe Source, low-quality redownload, and every other caller interpret the capability helper consistently;
- never disable `use_scheduler` or reject a queue action on API 24–30 merely because `canScheduleExactAlarms()` is an API-31 method;
- preserve the existing API-31+ permission-request/failure behavior when exact-alarm access is actually unavailable;
- add API-band tests for at least API 24/30, API 31+ with access, and API 31+ without access, plus a production-path queue regression proving pre-31 scheduler queueing persists work and arms the scheduler rather than returning the permission failure.

### BUG-ABI-01 — Do not publish non-arm64 APKs without the FFmpeg runtime they invoke

**State:** Open  
**Reviewed checkpoint:** `dfa40697434b7d041bb0bc4f3d9cf2586dfb6d15`  
**Verification:** `SOURCE-LEVEL ONLY`

**Failure path:** `app/build.gradle` explicitly enables release ABI outputs for `x86`, `x86_64`, `armeabi-v7a`, and `arm64-v8a` (plus a universal APK). FFmpeg wrapper dependencies are deliberately disabled, so the app-owned runtime is authoritative. The app-owned `jniLibs` tree, however, contains only `arm64-v8a`; that arm64 directory carries `libffmpeg.so`, `libffprobe.so`, the hard-sub executable variants, and their dependent libraries. The bundled runtime installer also derives `bin/<primary ABI>/ffmpeg_payload.zip`, but production assets contain that payload only for arm64; the x86_64 and armeabi-v7a asset directories contain only `yttml`, and there is no x86 asset directory. `App.installBundledFfmpegPayload()` wraps installation in `runCatching`, logs failure, and lets startup continue.

For every yt-dlp execution, `YoutubeDLCompat.resolveValidFfmpegLocation()` accepts FFmpeg only when both executable `nativeLibraryDir/libffmpeg.so` and `libffprobe.so` exist and the installed payload library directory exists. On the published non-arm64 ABI outputs those conditions cannot be established from the checked-in production artifacts, so no `--ffmpeg-location` is supplied. The hard-sub path is even less tolerant: `DownloadWorker.resolveFfmpegRuntime()` has only `nativeLibraryDir/libffmpeg.so` as its executable candidate and, after finding no usable candidate, falls back to that same first candidate anyway. FFmpeg process start therefore fails or media probes return no streams. Ordinary yt-dlp workflows that require FFmpeg post-processing/merging can fail on these APKs, while a normal hard-sub request can reach `burnSubtitlesInPlace()`, burn zero media, and continue to publish an unburned download because only History hard-sub re-downloads convert `burned == false` into a fatal exception.

**Why this is a defect:** the build advertises and version-codes production APKs for ABIs whose required FFmpeg execution authority is absent. This is not merely an unverified compatibility promise: real production callers gate merging/post-processing on those files, hard-sub directly attempts to execute the missing path, installer failure is non-fatal, and retry/restart cannot materialize an asset that is not packaged for that ABI. The same requested download can therefore have materially different correctness semantics solely because the user installed one of the explicitly published ABI variants. This is distinct from `BUG-HARDSUB-01` through `BUG-HARDSUB-03`, which own subtitle lookup, History replacement semantics, and destructive split-stream replacement respectively; none owns runtime availability across published ABIs.

**Ownership / attribution:** pre-existing baseline defect discovered post ledger split; not a remediation regression.

Required result:

- define the actual supported release ABI set and make generated APK/AAB outputs match it, or package a complete executable FFmpeg/ffprobe runtime plus required payload libraries for every ABI that remains published;
- make runtime resolution return an explicit unavailable outcome rather than an unusable fallback path, and propagate runtime-install failure to every workflow that requires FFmpeg instead of silently continuing;
- preserve normal no-FFmpeg workflows where FFmpeg is genuinely unnecessary, but never report hard-sub or FFmpeg-required post-processing as successfully completed when the runtime is unavailable;
- verify same-settings retry, raw/manual requeue, reconfigure, notification retry/resume, restart/reconcile, and History re-download: none may reinterpret a missing packaged runtime as transient success or silently downgrade a hard-sub request;
- add assembled-artifact/runtime verification for each published ABI and a production `DownloadWorker` regression that exercises an FFmpeg-required video merge and hard-sub request on every supported ABI. Helper-only source tests are insufficient; verification must prove the packaged runtime is executable and wired into the real worker path.
